# Advanced Large Language Models & Visualization Tools for Data Analytics Learning

Welcome to our project on **Advanced Large Language Models & Visualization Tools for Data Analytics Learning**! Our mission is to revolutionize the way non-computational professionals and students learn data analytics. We do this by harnessing the power of cutting-edge AI technologies like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-research/) and the advanced visualization capabilities of tools like [LIDA](https://github.com/microsoft/lida). Our research, supported by extensive case studies and published in specialized conferences and journals, shows how these tools can drastically improve both the speed and quality of data-related disciplines education. Join us on this exciting journey to make data analytics and data science more accessible, efficient, and engaging for everyone!



## Project Overview

This project, based on two comprehensive studies, explores the use of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and visualization tools to enhance data analytics learning for students and professionals from non-computational backgrounds. The methodologies and outcomes described herein underscore the significant benefits of integrating cutting-edge AI technologies into educational practices to foster a deeper understanding and more efficient execution of data analytics projects.

### Project Objectives

This project aims to address the challenges faced by non-computational students and professionals in learning data analytics. By leveraging tools like ChatGPT and LIDA, the project seeks to:
- Promote a comprehensive understanding of data analytics pipelines.
- Enhance programming skills through interactive AI assistance.
- Enable a wider adoption of AI tools in educational contexts.
- Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of data analytics project development.
