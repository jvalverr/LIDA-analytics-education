# Advanced Large Language Models & Visualization Tools for Data Analytics Learning

This repository presents a comprehensive project centered around leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and visualization tools to enhance data analytics learning. Our work has been documented in two key publications, demonstrating the progressive development and impactful outcomes of our approach.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to address the challenges faced by non-computational professionals and students in learning data analytics. By integrating LLMs and advanced visualization tools, we provide an innovative approach that simplifies the learning process and enhances the development of critical data analytics skills.

### Key Features

- **LIDA Integration:** Automatic generation of grammar-agnostic visualizations and infographics using LLMs.
- **GPT-4 API Usage:** Leveraging the powerful capabilities of GPT-4 for generating code snippets, explanations, and refined data analytics solutions.
- **Enhanced Learning:** Promoting deeper understanding through interactive and immersive learning experiences.
- **Efficiency:** Significant reduction in project development time, making data analytics more accessible and manageable.

## Publications

### 1. Initial Case Study
**Title:** Empowering Data Analytics Learning: Leveraging Advanced Large Language Models and Visualization Tools  
**Conference:** 19th World Conference on Continuing Engineering Education (IACEE 2024)  
**Authors:** Jorge Valverde-Rebaza, Aram Gonzalez, Octavio Navarro, Julieta Noguez  
**Summary:**  
This study explores the use of LIDA, a tool that integrates LLMs with the ChatGPT API (GPT-4), to aid students and professionals from non-computational backgrounds in learning data analytics. We conducted a case study with 30 students and 20 professionals, demonstrating that the integration of LIDA with GPT-4 significantly accelerated project development and enhanced learning outcomes. Participants experienced a 30% reduction in project development time and reported higher satisfaction with the learning process.

### 2. Advanced Study
**Title:** Advanced Large Language Models & Visualization Tools for Data Analytics Learning: An Empowering Approach for Fostering Competencies among Non-Computational Professionals and Students  
**Journal:** Frontiers in Education, Q2  
**Authors:** Jorge Valverde-Rebaza, Aram Gonzalez, Octavio Navarro-Hinojosa, Julieta Noguez  
**Summary:**  
Building on our initial study, this publication presents a more extensive case study involving 59 participants, including both students and professionals. The study investigates the effectiveness of combining LLMs with specialized visualization tools like LIDA in data analytics education. The results indicate that using these advanced tools not only improves the speed and accuracy of project development but also enhances the overall learning experience by fostering deeper understanding and engagement. The study highlights the potential of these technologies to democratize data analytics education for individuals from diverse backgrounds.
